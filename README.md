What is the Memory Game?

*Link view the live project here.

The memory game consists of fifth cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

*Rules
 
 Each turn:

   •	When it starts, you will have about 1.5 seconds to help you memorize the comics' characters.  
   •	A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying comics character.
   •	The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same comics character.
   •	If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
