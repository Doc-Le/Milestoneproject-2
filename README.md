The memory game consists of fifth cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

## Rules
 
 Each turn:

* When it starts, you will have about 1.5 seconds to help you memorize the comics' characters
* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying comics character
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same comics character
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched


It is designed to have easy access on a range of devices, with simple navigation.
